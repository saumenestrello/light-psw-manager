# LPM: Light Password Manager
*A simple password manager written in Python*

## Technical specs

### Project structure
The application is composed by three Python scripts: 
* **db_handler.py**: db communication and entry point of the program
* **gui.py**: gui elements and events
* **key_derivation.py**: key derivation from password

The project has two additional components, the configuration file and the database file.

The configuration file (**config.txt**) is a JSON file containing the path to the database (**property "db_path"**). If the program is unable to find a configuration file, it generates a new config.txt file that points to a database in the current directory (**storage.db**).

The database file can be selected by writing its path in the configuration file. If no path (or invalid) has been provided in config.txt, the program creates a new db in the current directory called **storage.db**.

### Encryption & storage
Credentials are stored in a SQLite3 database; the program communicate with it through Python **sqlite3** module. Python *Fernet* class (from cryptography library) takes care of credentials' symmetric encryption, using (taken from Fernet documentation):
* AES in CBC mode with a 128-bit key for encryption, using PKCS7 padding;
* HMAC using SHA256 for authentication;
* initialization vectors generated by os.urandom().

For key derivation PBKDF2HMAC algorithm is used. Database structure is very simple, it is composed by only one table called credentials. The schema is the following:
ID | ENCODED
------------ | -------------
credential ID | encrypted JSON object containing credential's username and password

The encrypted JSON object has this shape

```
{
  "user" : <username>,
  "psw" : <password>
 }
```

## Getting started

Just run **dist/LPM.exe** (under Windows,obviously). That's it.
